### 21B (Kappa)

<Var name={'21B (Kappa)'}/> has additional spike mutations at positions <AaMut mut={'S:E154K'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:E484Q'}/>, and <AaMut mut={'S:Q1071H'}/>.
In particular, mutations at position <Mut name="S:E484"/> have been linked to reduction in antibody binding, reinfection, and decrease in convalescent and vaccine serum neutralization.
However, many of these studies focused on <AaMut mut={'S:E484K'}/>, wereas the mutation in <Var name={'21B (Kappa)'}/> is <AaMut mut={'S:E484Q'}/>.

- Spike with <AaMut mut={'S:L452R'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:E484Q'}/>, and <AaMut mut={'S:P681R'}/> may have reduced cell-entry efficacy, and has modestly reduced sensitivity to vaccine-elicited antibodies (<LinkExternal href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.08.443253v1">Ferreria et al., bioRxiv</LinkExternal>)
