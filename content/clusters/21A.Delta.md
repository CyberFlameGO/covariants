### 21A (Delta)

<Var name={'21A (Delta)'}/> is considered a "Variant of Concern" by the WHO.

<Var name={'21A (Delta)'} prefix=""/> has additional spike mutations at positions <AaMut mut={'S:T19R'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:R158G'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:T478K'}/>, and <AaMut mut={'S:D950N'}/>. Additionally, it has a deletion at positions <AaMut mut={'S:E156-'}/> and <AaMut mut={'S:F157-'}/>.

Many sequences in <Var name={'21A (Delta)'} prefix=""/> also have a deletion at positions <AaMut mut={'ORF8:D119-'}/> and <AaMut mut={'ORF8:F120-'}/>.

- [The PHE technical briefings](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/investigation-of-novel-sars-cov-2-variant-variant-of-concern-20201201) contain assessments of <Var name={'21A (Delta)'} prefix=""/>'s transmissibility 

Some <Var name={'21A (Delta)'} prefix=""/> viruses have acquired an additional mutation at position <Mut name="S:K417"/> to N (click the mutation badge for more information on this mutation).
Two specific clusters of this mutation in <Var name={'21A (Delta)'} prefix=""/> have Pango lineage designations <Lin name="AY.1" /> and <Lin name="AY.2" />.

A Nextstrain build focused on <Var name={'21A (Delta)'} prefix=""/> sequences with the <AaMut mut={'S:K417N'}/> mutation (including the two lineages above) can be seen [here](https://nextstrain.org/groups/neherlab/ncov/21A.Delta.S.K417?c=gt-S_417&f_clade_membership=21A%20%28Delta%29&label=clade:21A%20%28Delta%29).
