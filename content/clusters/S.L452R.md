### S:L452R
- In a study co-incubating psueotyped virus with SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and monocolonal antibodies, viruses with `S:L452R` mutations escaped neutralization by monoclonal antibodies SARS2-01, SARS-02, and SARS2-32 and some convalescent sera. Additionally, this study found modest increase in infectivity as measured by soluble mACE2 ([Liu et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.06.372037v1))
- Experimentally, Spike gene expression increased 0.32 fold with this mutation ([Starr et al., Cell](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.012)).
- Ranked effective mutant against this position in the RBD for highly neutralizing COV2-2096 ([Greaney et al., Cell Host & Microbe](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom.2020.11.007)).
- Escape mutation against monoclonal antibody LY-CoV555, the antibody that forms the basis for Eli Lilly's bamlanivimab treatment for COVID-19 ([Starr et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.17.431683v1)).
- Resistent to some neutralizing antibodies: mAbs X593 and P2B-2F6 ([Li et al., Cell](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092867420308771)).
