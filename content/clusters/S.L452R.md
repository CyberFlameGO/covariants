### S:L452R
- In a study co-incubating psuedotyped virus with SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and monocolonal antibodies, viruses with `S:L452R` mutations escaped neutralization by monoclonal antibodies SARS2-01, SARS-02, and SARS2-32 and some convalescent sera. Additionally, this study found modest increase in infectivity as measured by soluble mACE2 ([Liu et al., bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.06.372037v1))

_Little else is known about this mutation. Please let me know if you have more information!_
