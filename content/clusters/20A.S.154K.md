### 20A/S:154K

<Var name={'20A/S:154K'}/> has additional spike mutations at positions <AaMut mut={'S:E154K'}/>, <AaMut mut={'S:E484Q'}/>, and <AaMut mut={'S:Q1071H'}/>.
In particular, mutations at position <Mut name="S:E484"/> have been linked to reduction in antibody binding, reinfection, and decrease in convalescent and vaccine serum neutralization.
However, many of these studies focused on <AaMut mut={'S:E484K'}/>, wereas the mutation in <Var name={'20A/S:154K'}/> is <AaMut mut={'S:E484Q'}/>.
