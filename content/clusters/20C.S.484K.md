Also known as `B.1.526`

<Var name="20C/S:484K"/> is largely found within the USA, particularly in New York state, and seems to have arisen in late 2020. 
<br/>

<Var name="20C/S:484K" prefix=""/> contains a mutation in <Mut name="S:E484"/>, like the 2 of the variants of concern and some other currently circulating clusters. Further, this variant has the same 3 amino acid deletion in `ORF1a` at positions 3675-5677 that is seen in all three variants of concern, as well as in <Var name="20A/S:484K"/>.
<br/>

Additionally, the variant has spike mutations at positions <AaMut mut={"S:L5F"}/>, <AaMut mut={"S:T95I"}/>, <AaMut mut={"S:D253G"}/>, and <AaMut mut={"S:A701V"}/> (shared with <Var name="20H/501Y.V2"/>).

Two sister-clade to this variant carries many of the same mutations but lack <Mut name="S:E484"/>. One does not have <AaMut mut={"S:A701V"}/> and instead has <Mut name="S:S477"/> and <AaMut mut={"S:Q957R"}/>. The other has both <AaMut mut={"S:A701V"}/> and <Mut name="S:S477"/>.

These can be see on the dedicated build (link at top of this page) by zooming in near to <Var name="20A/S:484K" prefix=""/> and coloring by Spike position 477.

- <AaMut mut={"S:A701V"}/> is near the furin cleavage site, and <AaMut mut={"S:D253G"}/> is located in a region of the N-terminal domain which is a target for neutralizing antibodies (<LinkExternal href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.23.21252259v1">Annavajhala et al., medRxiv</LinkExternal>)
- The variant was observed to rise rapidly in prevalence in New York (<LinkExternal href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.23.21252259v1">Annavajhala et al., medRxiv</LinkExternal>, <LinkExternal href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.26.21251868v1">Lasek-Nesselquist et al., medRxiv</LinkExternal>)
