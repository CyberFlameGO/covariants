### 21I (Delta)
Also known as <Who name="Delta" />

<Var name={'21I (Delta)'}/> is part of the a "Variant of Concern" <Var name="21A (Delta)" prefix=""/>. It is a sub-clade of the larger <Who name="Delta" /> clade, which has grown extensively worldwide, particularly in some parts of Asia.
<br /><br />

<Var name={'21I (Delta)'}/> has all the mutations of <Var name="21A (Delta)" prefix=""/>. In addition, it has an extra mutation in Spike at position <AaMut mut={'S:A222V'}/> (see <Var name="20E (EU1)" prefix=""/> page for more details). It also has additional amino-acid mutations in `ORF1a`: <AaMut mut={'ORF1a:P1640L'}/>, <AaMut mut={'ORF1a:A3209V'}/>, <AaMut mut={'ORF1a:V3718A'}/>, and <AaMut mut={'ORF1a:T3750I'}/>. 

Finally, <Var name={'21I (Delta)'}/> has synonymous nucleotide mutations at positions <NucMut mut="A5584G" /> and <NucMut mut="C13019T" />.
