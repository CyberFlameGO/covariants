The grey colour between the top of the coloured curve and '1' on the Y-axis is composed of variants, lineages, and mutations that we don't currently track.

Since mutations could appear in multiple variant, only variants are plotted below.

**In early 2021** many places have started preferentially sequencing samples to detect the main variants of concern (see <Var name="20I/501Y.V1" prefix=""/>, <Var name="20H/501Y.V2" prefix=""/>, <Var name="20J/501Y.V3" prefix=""/>). Often this is through sequencing samples that have an 'S-drop-out,' which in particular biases the frequencies of <Var name="20A/S:439K"/> and 501Y.V1 (shown here as a bias in the 3 variants of concern). Alternatively, this can be through preferentially sequencing cases with particular travel histories, or connections to known cases of the variants of concern.

It is worth interpreting with caution:
- The last data point - this often has incomplete data and may change as more sequences come in
- Frequencies that are very 'jagged' - this often indicates low sequencing numbers and so may not be truly representative of the country
- In many places, sampling may not be equal across the region: samples may only cover one area or certain areas. It's important not to assume frequencies shown are necessarily representative.
