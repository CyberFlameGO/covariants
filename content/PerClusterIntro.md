In the graphs below, the proportion of **sequences** (_not cases_) from each country that are designated as being that cluster, are plotted.

Countries are displayed in the chart if the country has at least 300 sequences present in that cluster.

Note the frequencies are displayed by week, but values are smoothed in order to dampen week-on-week jitter in sequencing.
